#### Installation

In order to start implementing your own project, the easiest way is to execute the commands:

```
composer create-project php-service-bus/skeleton my-project
```

After installation, you will have a completely ready-to-use application with test handlers.

#### Demo application

There is a [small demo application](https://github.com/php-service-bus/demo) that will allow you to study the main aspects of the framework.
To run the example, you only need Docker and Docker Compose.
